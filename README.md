//# Genetk

A toolkit for genetic analysis.

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/brainfo/genetk.git
```

## Features

- Use gseapy for gene set enrichment analysis
  - given gtf file, annotate and select only protein-coding genes for enrichment
  - The gseapy plotting utils support mapping q values to colors for dot plots but not barplots. They have barplots with fixed float (p or q values) as one axis, and at most color by database groups.
    - thus, here's a simple barplot function for flexibly choosing field as axis and mapping colors
  - Support both explorary saving out all sig terms directly from fresh analysis, or pre-saved tables
    - for pre-saved tables, the plot saving is boosted with plutils package
  - from the output gsea enriched table, use networkx for network analysis for the Terms. the edge is weighted by the Jaccard index of the Genes between Terms.
- Use magma to enrich for GWAS hits
- Use networkx for Network analysis given any edge list, e.g. from PPI analysis
  - In-degree, Out-degree, and Betweenness centrality
  - Find communities

## Example Usage

1. for enrichment analysis given DEGs

given an excel of all DEG results with sheetnames, output **all** GO ORA and GSEA results tables and visualize **all** significant terms.

default using databases 'MSigDB_Hallmark_2020', 'KEGG_2021_Human', and 'GO_Biological_Process_2023'

see `src/genetk/enrich/go_enrichment.py`

Output:
  - ORA enrichment tables and one barplot for all enriched terms from given databases
  - GSEA enrichment tables from each database, GSEA plots with each significant term, one GSEA plot with all significant terms

2. Barplot of enriched terms (likely from 1. or any other dataframe)
   
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  import numpy as np

  test_file = "test/GO_Biological_Process_2023.human.enrichr.reports.txt" 
  ```

  ```python
  df = pd.read_csv(test_file, sep='\t')
  genetk.enrich.go.barh(df, 'GO', 'down', 'exact', save = 'test.pdf', return_ax=False)
  ```


3. network analysis (Term-level) of enriched terms
 
  ```python
  from genetk.network.go_network import GONetwork
  go_net = GONetwork(test_file)

  filtered_net = go_net.filter_nodes_by_attribute('odds_ratio')
  edge_filtered_net = filtered_net.filter_edges_by_weight()

  communities = edge_filtered_net.community(resolution=0.5)
  num_communities = len(set(communities.values()))

  os.makedirs('figures', exist_ok=True)

  edge_filtered_net.bubble(
  name='test_community',
  community_colored=True,
  text_annot=True
  )

  ## output figure test/figures/test_community_go_network.pdf
  ```
